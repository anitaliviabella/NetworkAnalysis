SCENE 1,"First Witch, Second Witch, Third Witch, Hecate","The witches cast a spell around a cauldron. Hecate congratulates them. Macbeth visits the witches, and they show him three apparitions. Firstly, an armed head appears, saying that Macbeth should ‘beware Macduff’. Secondly, a bloody child appears, saying ‘none of woman born shall harm Macbeth’. Thirdly, a crowned child holding a tree appears, saying that he will never be defeated ‘until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane hill shall come against him’. Macbeth is reassured but asks if Banquo’s descendants will ever reign. The witches advise against his question, but he demands that they answer. An apparition of eight kings appears following Banquo’s ghost. Macbeth is terrified and angry, but the witches disappear. Lennox arrives with word that Macduff has fled to England. Privately, Macbeth vows to kill all of Macduff’s family, including ’his wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line'."
SCENE 2,"Lady Macduff, Ross","Lady Macduff worries about why her husband has fled to England. Ross reassures her that Macduff is ‘noble, wise, judicious’ but dares not tell her any more and leaves. Lady Macduff tells her son that his father is dead and was a traitor, but he teases her and knows it is not true. A messenger advises Lady Macduff to flee with her family, but she does not go, saying she has ‘done no harm’. Murderers arrive seeking Macduff and, finding him gone, they kill both his son and wife."
SCENE 3,"Macduff, Malcolm, Old Siward, Doctor","In England, Macduff tells Malcolm of how Scotland is suffering under the ‘tyrant’ Macbeth. Malcolm is suspicious of Macduff and tests his loyalty by saying that if Malcolm became king, his own ‘vices’ would be worse than Macbeth's. Macduff excuses several of Malcolm’s flaws. However, when Malcolm claims that he will bring chaos to Scotland were he to rule, Macduff condemns him, saying his ‘hope ends here’. Seeing Macduff’s response, Malcolm’s suspicions are gone, and he tells Macduff that he was ‘false speaking’ and is, in fact, devoted to his country and people. Malcolm is ready with Old Siward and 10,000 men to invade Scotland. A doctor tells how King Edward cures people through touch, which is a gift bestowed on true kings. Ross arrives to tell Macduff the terrible news about the death of his wife and children. Malcolm comforts Macduff, advising that they ‘make us medicines of our great revenge to cure this deadly grief'."
